//  The Platform for Unified Leadership in Smart Environments.
//
//  This program is distributed to enable communities to build and maintain their own
//  digital sovereignty through local control of critical infrastructure data.
//
//  By open sourcing Pulse, we create a circular economy where contributors can both build
//  upon and benefit from the platform, ensuring that value flows back to communities rather
//  than being extracted by external entities. This aligns with our commitment to intergenerational
//  prosperity through collaborative stewardship of public infrastructure.
//
//  This program is free software: communities can deploy it for sovereignty, academia can
//  extend it for research, and industry can integrate it for resilience — all under the terms
