        Changed from direct MapPolygon.onHover (not supported) to:
        1. Selection-based interaction for polygon details
        2. Optional onContinuousHover on the map view for future enhancement
        3. Confidence tooltip shows for selected polygons instead of hovered
        """,

        "Detailed Hull Integration": """
        Integrated detailed hull generation into PolygonGroupingService:
        1. generateEnhancedDetailedHull() with dense point cloud generation
        2. refineConcaveHull() for alpha-based concavity control
        3. simplifyPolygonForRendering() for MapKit optimization
        """,

        "Concurrency Patterns": """
        Maintained proper SwiftUI concurrency:
        1. All async methods properly await results
        2. MainActor isolation for UI updates
        3. Task cancellation support with proper cleanup
        4. Progressive loading with real-time progress updates

        "UI Responsiveness": """
        Enhanced UI responsiveness through:
        1. Background processing with Task.yield() calls
        2. Progressive loading indicators with progress bars
        3. Cancellable operations for better user control
        4. Smooth animations and transitions

        Could implement custom coordinate transformation to detect mouse position over polygons,

        Could keep as separate class but would require complex dependency injection through
        the actor system. Integration provides cleaner architecture and better performance.

        "Chunked Processing": """
        Previous chunked processing approach was removed in favor of more efficient spatial
        indexing and actor-based processing. Provides better performance and simpler code.
