Pulse unifies your infrastructure into a single, real-time digital twin. See every network device, monitor critical systems, and analyze historical patterns - all from one native Apple application. Pulse transforms siloed infrastructure data into actionable intelligence while maintaining complete local control.

## What Pulse Does

### Unified Infrastructure Visualization
Pulse connects to your existing NetBox instance to create an interactive digital twin of your infrastructure. See all devices, connections, and dependencies in real-time 2D visualizations and 3D maps. During outages or emergencies, instantly understand impact, scope and affected systems.

### Real-Time Monitoring Integration
Through Zabbix integration, Pulse displays live status for every device, with automatic alerting and historical analysis. Track patterns, identify recurring issues, and predict failures before they impact services.

### Cross-Boundary Coordination
When disasters strike, jurisdictional boundaries become irrelevant. Pulse enables secure, controlled information sharing between organizations - councils can coordinate with utilities, emergency services can see critical infrastructure status, and communities can work together while maintaining data sovereignty.

### Local Processing, Local Control
All data processing happens on your hardware. No cloud dependencies, no external vulnerabilities, no vendor lock-in. Run Pulse on as little as a Mac mini or iPhone, scaling up as your needs grow.
