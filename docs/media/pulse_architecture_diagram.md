## Understanding the Architecture

### How to Read This Diagram

This diagram shows the three key layers of the Pulse platform and how data flows between them:

**Left to Right Data Flow:**
1. **Infrastructure Sources** (left) ‚Üí **Pulse Platform** (center) ‚Üí **User Interfaces** (right)
2. Data is collected from your existing systems, processed and unified, then presented through native Apple interfaces

### Component Details

<details>
<summary><strong>Infrastructure Sources (Input Layer)</strong></summary>

These are your existing systems that Pulse connects to:
- **NetBox**: Provides device inventory, network topology, and asset management data
- **Zabbix**: Supplies real-time monitoring data, alerts, and performance metrics
- **Cameras**: Streams live video feeds for security and operational monitoring
- **IoT Sensors**: Delivers environmental data like temperature, humidity, and power usage

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Pulse Platform (Processing Layer)</strong></summary>

The core engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights:
- **API Layer**: Handles secure communication with all data sources using their native APIs
- **Local Cache**: SwiftData-powered local storage for fast access and offline operation
- **Unified Memory**: In-memory data structures that create a single coherent view of your infrastructure
- **Processing Engine**: Local analytics and AI that detect patterns, anomalies, and generate insights
- **Visualization Layer**: Renders data into maps, charts, and interactive displays using MapKit and SwiftUI

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>User Interfaces (Output Layer)</strong></summary>

Native Apple applications optimized for different use cases:
- **macOS**: Full desktop experience for detailed analysis and administration
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Mobile interface for field work and quick status checks
- **tvOS**: Large-screen dashboards for operations centers (planned feature)
- **visionOS**: 3D infrastructure visualization (future roadmap)

</details>

### Architecture Characteristics

**Local-First Design**: All processing happens on your devices - no data leaves your network unless you choose to sync between your own devices via CloudKit.

**Unified Memory Model**: Instead of querying multiple systems repeatedly, Pulse maintains a comprehensive in-memory model of your entire infrastructure that updates in real-time.

**Native Apple Integration**: Built specifically for Apple's ecosystem using SwiftUI, SwiftData, and platform-specific APIs for optimal performance and user experience.
